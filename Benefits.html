                        Immune system is your body's first-line defense against 
                        invaders like germs. It helps protect you from getting 
                        sick and promotes healing when you are unwell or injured.
                        You can strengthen the immune system by getting enough sleep.

                        Sleep is essential to regulate Hormones that affect 
                        hunger and appetite. Appetite is not just a matter 
                        of stomach grumbling. The neurotransmitters, the 
                        chemical messengers control the appetite by allowing 
                        neurons (nerve cells) to communicate with one another. 
                        Ghrelin promotes hunger and leptin contributes to 
                        feeling of fullness. Getting enough sleep prevents 
                        dysregulation of these neurotransmitters which will 
                        cause excess calories.

                        As getting enough sleep strengthen the immune system 
                        that is important defense against invaders like germs. 
                        The invaders include Bacteria, Viruses, Fungi that can 
                        cause infections and Parasites. Immune system is keeping 
                        those invaders out of the body and destroying them and 
                        healing damage to our body.

                        Stress is a response to adverse and challenging 
                        circumstances and a response to daily life. It 
                        affects us emotionally, physically, and behaviorally. 
                        The right amount of stress can be a positive force that 
                        helps us to do our best and to keep alert and energetic. 
                        But too much can make us tense and anxious. A good 
                        night's sleep makes you able to tackle the day's stress 
                        more easily. When you are tired, you are less patient and 
                        more easily agitated, which can increase stress. As 
                        stress getting lower, your mood improves.

                        Getting enough sleep help you feeling rested and 
                        energetic. When you are tired, you can not function at 
                        your best. Sleep helps you think more clearly, have 
                        quicker reflexes and focus better. Better sleep helps 
                        the brain make connections and solve problems, fueling 
                        the creative process. Without sleep, the brain struggles 
                        to form ideas and perform at its best.

                    <p class="text">
                        Loneliness is associated with poor sleep. A person 
                        become socially avoidant, keeping greater social 
                        distance from others. Also lack of sleep causes 
                        aggression. It causes you to be angrier and impatient. 
                        People who sleep poorly are more frequently aggressive 
                        toward their partners and friends. Our ability to turn 
                        down emotional upset is compromised when we don't get 
                        enough sleep. That means our anger can get out of control, 
                        making us more likely to blame and target others. Getting 
                        enough sleep allows us to have more self-control, help us 
                        empathize with others. So, if we know they are feeling sad, 
                        we can care about how she is doing and cheer her up.
