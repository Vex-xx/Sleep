                        Even just one night of less than 5 hours sleep can 
                        impair short-term memory. We ourselves are aware that 
                        the next day we have a hard time remembering things: 
                        'Where did I leave my keys? What's that person's name? 
                        During sleep your brain forms connection that help you 
                        process and remember new information. A lack of sleep 
                        can negatively impact both short and long-term memory.

                        Mood Swings are sudden changes in how you feel. Sleep 
                        Deprivation can make you moody, emotional, and 
                        quick-tempered. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect 
                        your mood and lead to anxiety or depression. If you 
                        don't get enough sleep, you might feel cranky. You will 
                        be angry more frequently and easily.

                        Without enough sleep, your brain cells do not work as 
                        efficiently and you may have trouble concentrating. If 
                        you haven't sleep well, you may struggle to fully pay 
                        attention of what's in front of you or around you. You 
                        are also more likely to make poor choices throughout the 
                        day.

                        Immune system is critical to overall health. It is 
                        fundamental to healing wounds, warding off infections, 
                        and protecting against chronic and life-threatening 
                        illnesses. Consistent sleep strengthens the immune 
                        system, allowing for balanced and effective immune 
                        function. Lack of sleep on the other hand, can impair 
                        the Immune system.

                        The neurotransmitters Ghrelin promotes hunger, and 
                        Leptin contributes to feeling full. These two need to 
                        be regulated by getting enough sleep. The dysregulation 
                        of ghrelin and leptin may lead to increased appetite and 
                        diminished feeling of fullness. You will consume more 
                        calories than you need for a day. Sleeping also help 
                        the body to burn calories. Without enough sleep, the 
                        body can't perform this efficiently. The calories intake 
                        and the calories you use up each day will be unbalanced. 
                        This might lead you to be overweight or obese.

                        If you don't get enough sleep, the body's ability to 
                        regulate glucose level is disrupted. Insulin is a 
                        hormone created by your pancreas that controls the 
                        amount of glucose in the bloodstream at any given 
                        moment. It also helps transfer glucose from the blood 
                        to the muscles, fat, and liver, and other cells. 
                        Insulin resistance occurs when the body has trouble 
                        producing insulin, or when the insulin fails to transfer 
                        glucose into these cells. This leads to a build-up of 
                        glucose in the blood, otherwise known as high blood 
                        sugar.

                <p class="text">
                    Heart is responsible for pumping blood throughout the 
                    body and powers the circulatory system that ensures 
                    that all the organs and tissues in the body get the 
                    oxygen they need. Sleep is an essential time for the 
                    body to recuperate. During the non-rapid eye movement 
                    (NREM) sleep stages, heart rate slows, blood pressure 
                    drop, and breathing stabilizes. These changes reduce 
                    stress on the heart, allowing it to recover from strain 
                    that occurs during waking hours. Without enough sleep, 
                    a person doesn't spend enough time in the deep stages of 
                    NREM sleep that benefit the heart. Chronic sleep 
                    deprivation is associated with numerous heart problems 
                    including high blood pressure, irregular heart rate, 
                    chest pain, heart attack and stroke.

                <h1  class="subtitle">Heart Attack and Stroke</h1>
    
                <p class="text">
                    A heart attack happens when the flow of blood to the 
                    heart gets blocked. Heart drops during the NREM sleep 
                    stages and then picks back up as you prepare to wake up. 
                    Sleep interruptions have also been linked to the 
                    potential for heart attacks. Because both heart rate and 
                    blood pressure can be negatively affected. Fragmented 
                    sleep can cause cardiac stress and may induce a heart 
                    attack. A stroke is when blood flow to the brain is cut 
                    off, causing brain cells to dies from lack of oxygen. 
                    Ischemic strokes occur when a blood clot or plaque blocks 
                    an artery. Sleep deprivation increases blood pressure, 
                    and high blood pressure is considered to be the leading 
                    risk factor for strokes. In addition, by contributing to 
                    plaque build-up in the arteries, insufficient sleep may 
                    make it easier for blockages to occur and cause mini-strokes 
                    or strokes.
