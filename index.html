                        Sleep is the best way to take a rest. It doesn't only rest our body movement 
                        it also reduced some activity of the brain. There are some brain activities 
                        that needs to be done while we are asleep. Such as restoration of Muscular, 
                        Skeletal, Nervous, and Immune system. These all functions are important to 
                        maintain the mood and keep us active during daytime. It also help memorizing 
                        things better and keeping us healthy. So, we can learn quite well and help thinking 
                        to have better idea. Internal Alarm clocks of Human promotes sleep daily at night. It 
                        synchronized with the solar time (Solar time is the calculation of passage of time based 
                        on the position of sun in the sky). An adult should sleep 7-8 hours for a day. For children 
                        it is recommended around 10 hours. A new born baby needs 14-17 hours. Sleep is very important 
                        routine which you shouldn't be careless about. People who doesn't have enough sleep especially 
                        those who sleep less than 5 hours a day are most likely to suffer diabetes and heart related disease.

                    <p class="text">
                        Sleeping doesn't mean the brain is totally inactive. 
                        Sleep occurs in repeating sleep cycle. There are two 
                        categories in sleep cycle. NREM (Non-Rapid Eyes movement) 
                        and REM (Rapid Eyes Movement). NREM is composed of three stages. 
                        Stage 1 (N1), Stage 2 (N2) and Stage 3 (N3). REM is the phase dreams 
                        most likely to happen. Each sleep cycle last 90 to 120 minutes. 
                        The duration gets longer as the night goes on. An adult have Four to 
                        Five sleep cycle which is enough sleep time for a day. An adult needs 
                        7 - 8 hour sleeps time, Teenage needs 9 - 10 hours. Young Children needs 
                        10 - 14 hours and Newborn baby needs 14 - 17 hours daily.

                <h1 class="subtitle">Stage 1</h1>
    
                <p class="text">
                    Stage 1 : N1 is the first stage a person enter right after he fell asleep. 
                    Also known as light sleep. In this stage, the body is not fully relaxed, 
                    though the body and brain activity are getting slow. It is easy to wake 
                    the person up. If this stage is not interrupted, it last about 7 minutes 
                    then the person enters the Stage 2(N2).
                </p>
            
    
    
            <h1 class="subtitle">Stage 2</h1>
    
            <p class="text">
                Stage 2 : N2 is also light sleep . During N2,there is a drop in body 
                temperature, relaxed muscles, slowed breathing and heart rate. At the 
                same time, brain waves show a new pattern and there are short bursts of 
                activity that help resist being woken up by external stimuli.
                <br><br>
                N2 last 10 - 25 minutes. The duration becomes longer in each sleep cycle 
                during the night. A person spent half of the sleep time in N2 sleep.
            </p>
    
            <h1 class="subtitle">Stage 3</h1>
    
            <p class="text">
                Stage 3 : N3 is the most important part of the sleep cycle. Also known as 
                deep sleep. In this stage, Muscle tone, Pulse and Breathing rate decrease as 
                the body relaxed even further. You need N3 sleep to wake up feeling rested. 
                Without N3 sleep, you feel tired and drained even if you slept for a long time. 
                If this happens you should go see the doctor.
                <br><br>
                N3 allows the brain to perform restoration of vital processes. Such as Muscle, 
                Nervous, Skeletal and Immune system. These processes help to maintain the mood, 
                think creatively, memorize better and keep us healthy. During the first sleep cycle, 
                N3 last 20 to 40 minutes. As you continue sleeping, Duration of N3 gets shorter and REM longer instead.
            </p>
    
            <h1 class="subtitle">REM</h1>
    
            <p class="text">
                REM : Eyes moving rapidly under the eyelids. The Muscle is paralyzed. Most dreams happen 
                in this phase. Dream is the succession of images, idea, emotion, and sensation. It takes 
                9min to 20min. During REM, the brain activity looks similar to that of while you are awake. 
                Experts believe that REM is also essential for the brain. REM last 20 - 60 minutes. 
                The duration is short in the first sleep cycle. But as the night goes on, it is getting longer.
            <br><br>
                The structure of a person's sleep stages and cycles is known as sleep architecture. 
                Experts believe that each stage of sleep plays a part in a healthy sleep architecture 
                that generates quality sleep.

                    Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that can make it hard to fall 
                    asleep or stay asleep. It also can cause you to wake up too early
                    and not be able to get back to sleep. You may still feel tired
                    when you wake up. Insomnia can drain your energy level and affect
                    your mood. It also can affect your health, work performance.
                    At some point, many adults have short-term insomnia. 
                    This can last for days or weeks. Short-term insomnia is usually due to stress 
                    or a distressing event. But some people have long-term insomnia, also called 
                    chronic insomnia. This lasts for three months or more. Insomnia may be the main 
                    problem, or it may be related to other medical conditions or medicines. 
                    You do not have to put up with sleepless nights. Simple changes in your daily habits often can help.

                        Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder that happens 
                        when your breathing stops and starts while you're 
                        asleep. If it goes untreated, it can cause loud 
                        snoring, daytime tiredness, or more serious problems 
                        like heart trouble or high blood pressure.

                        This condition is different from regular, or primary, 
                        snoring. Primary snoring may be caused by nose or 
                        throat conditions, your sleep style (especially back sleeping), 
                        being overweight or older, or using alcohol or other depressants. 
                        While both types of snoring happen when tissues in the back of your 
                        throat vibrate, people with sleep apnea tend to:

                    <p class="text">
                        Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects the 
                        brain's ability to control sleep-wake cycles. People with 
                        narcolepsy may feel rested after waking, but then feel very 
                        sleepy throughout much of the day. Many individuals with narcolepsy 
                        also experience uneven and interrupted sleep that can involve waking 
                        up frequently during the night.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text">
                        Narcolepsy can greatly affect daily activities. People may unwillingly 
                        fall asleep even if they are in the middle of an activity like 
                        driving, eating, or talking. Other symptoms may include sudden 
                        muscle weakness while awake that makes a person go limp or unable 
                        to move (cataplexy), vivid dream-like images or hallucinations, 
                        and total paralysis just before falling asleep or just after waking 
                        up (sleep paralysis).

                    <p class="text">
                        In a normal sleep cycle, a person enters rapid eye movement 
                        (REM) sleep after about 60 to 90 minutes. Dreams occur during 
                        REM sleep, and the brain keeps muscles limp during this sleep 
                        stage, which prevents people from acting out their dreams. 
                        People with narcolepsy frequently enter REM sleep rapidly, 
                        within 15 minutes of falling asleep. Also, the muscle weakness 
                        or dream activity of REM sleep can occur during wakefulness or 
                        be absent during sleep. This helps explain some symptoms of 
                        narcolepsy.
